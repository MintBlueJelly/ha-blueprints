    ## Description
    This blueprint handles button presses from Hue Dimmer Switches integrated via ZHA (model RWL021).

    ## Current version
    xqw-v1.0.0

    ## Updates
    - This blueprint is designed to be updatable within major versions (e.g. `xxx-v1.x.x`).
    - If a breaking change is unavoidable, it will trigger a new major version (e.g. `xxx-v2.0.0`).
    - Each major version will be published as a new blueprint in my GitHub repository (e.g. `xxx-v2.yaml`).
    - Minor version updates will be patched into the existing blueprint. They can be safely pulled into your Home Assistant instance by re-importing the blueprint via its context menu.
